            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a highschooler in Canada who enjoys coding, building/tinkering things, gaming, looking at anything that catches my attention, and other stuff. Whether it's automating tasks, working with AI/Machine Learning Models, modding or creating extensions to games, I'm always working on something.

            <h2>Coding Stuff</h2>
            <p>It all started when I was in grade school. My teacher introduced the class to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, a block-based visual coding website that people from all over the world use to create and share apps and games. When I saw this, I took full advantage of it. I created cool arcade games, story boards, and even went as far as make a calculator that would calculate properties of polygons to help me understand a school assignment.</p>
            <p>Fast forward a couple of years, I moved onto <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>, a slightly more mature online game platform where people can make and share their creations. This was my first time using a text-based language, called <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a>.</p>
