                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a highschooler in Canada who enjoys coding, and tinkering with new things.

            <section id="coding-stuff">
                <h2>Coding Stuff</h2>
                <p>It all started when I was in grade school. My teacher introduced the class to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about" target="_blank">Scratch</a> — a block-based visual coding website that people from all over the world use to create and share apps and games. When I saw this, I took full advantage of it. I created cool arcade games, story boards, and even went as far as make a calculator that would calculate properties of polygons to help me understand a school assignment.</p>
                <p>Fast forward a couple of years, and I moved onto <a href="https://www.roblox.com/" target="_blank">Roblox</a> — a slightly more mature online game platform where people can make and share their creations. This was my first time using any sort of text-based language (this one in particular was derived from <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html" target="_blank">Lua</a>, called <a href="https://luau.org/" target="_blank">LuaU</a>). I made many genres of games on this platform, some gaining a couple visits while others gaining hundreds. However, this was a major stepping stone for me, as it introduced me to the basics of a server-client app.</p>
                <p>It didn't stop there. Once I entered highschool, I started looking at other languages such as <a href="https://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>. This was arguably one of my best decisions.</p>
                <p>The thought of coding in <i>Java</i> or <i>Python</i> was hard to maintain. Since at the time I lacked project ideas, and the enthusiasm towards learning new coding languages slowly died down. After all, as long as I stayed with <i>Roblox</i> and <i>Lua</i>, I could create and publish endless amounts of games. However, I managed to keep a consistent routine, which helped me pull through.</p>
                <p>Today, I code on a daily basis. Whether it's for a school project or for fun, a web app or a desktop app, a program that tracks events in a game or a silly stuffy that bounces around at the bottom of the screen, I find a lot of joy in it. I even learned how to use cloud backup software such as GitHub (you can see some stats to the right).</p>

                <h2>Robotics</h2>
                <p>In grade 10, I joined my school's robotics team as a software member. This motivated me to pick up <i>Java</i> and <i>Python</i> once again. However this time, I actually had a real-world project where I could apply this knowledge.</p>
                <p>I went from being completely clueless, to somewhat knowledgable in the architechture of a robot, to being a key member in the team. The advantage of being in the team is being able to have hands-on experience with real-world machinery, recieve guidance from real professionals, and travel to new places to compete in a fast-paced environment. Even while my primary role was to code a robot, I was able to learn a lot of real-world concepts when it comes to engineering moving parts that I could definetly apply in the future, if I choose to work in a similar environment.</p>
                <p>This was a real game changer for me, and it's safe to say that our team achieved a lot.</p>
